# Arduino-Temperature-Activated-Stepper-Motor-with-DHT11-and-LEDs
This sketch is a Temperature-Controlled Stepper Motor Project using Arduino, DHT11, and 28BYJ-48.

üîç How it works
1Ô∏è‚É£ Hardware used

Arduino (Uno, Nano, etc.)

28BYJ-48 stepper motor with ULN2003 driver

DHT11 temperature sensor

4 LEDs for visual indicator

2Ô∏è‚É£ Program flow

Setup:

Initialize DHT11 sensor.

Configure Stepper motor with 2048 steps/revolution and speed of 8 RPM.

Set up 4 LEDs and turn them on permanently.

Loop:

Read temperature from DHT11.

If temperature > 24¬∞C, rotate the stepper motor 10 steps.

Otherwise, the motor remains stationary.

Print temperature values to the Serial Monitor for monitoring.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Notes

myStepper.step(10) can be adjusted for faster or slower rotation.

The 4 LEDs act as a constant visual indicator, not directly related to motor control.

DHT11 readings may occasionally fail, so isnan() check is necessary.
